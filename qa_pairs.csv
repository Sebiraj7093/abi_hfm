Green/white candles indicate price increases, red/black candles show decreases. Start with basic chart reading before using advanced technical analysis."
qa_132,What is slippage in trading?,"Slippage occurs when your trade is executed at a different price than expected, usually during high volatility or low liquidity periods.

qa_134,How do I calculate profit and loss?,"Profit/Loss = (Close Price - Open Price) × Position Size × Pip Value. For buy positions, profit occurs when close price > open price. For sell positions, profit occurs when close price < open price. Your trading platform automatically calculates P&L in real-time. Remember to account for spread costs when calculating net profit."
qa_135,What is hedging in forex?,"Hedging involves opening opposite positions to reduce risk exposure. For example, if you're long EUR/USD, you might short EUR/GBP to hedge against EUR weakness. HFM allows hedging on the same instrument (going long and short simultaneously). While hedging can limit losses, it also caps potential profits and increases trading costs."

Start with demo to practice, then transition to live when confident."

qa_140,How do I enable two-factor authentication?,"To enable 2FA, log into your myHF area, go to Security Settings, and follow the setup instructions. You'll typically need to download an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy), scan a QR code, and enter a verification code. 2FA adds extra security by requiring both your password and a time-based code from your phone."
qa_141,What should I do if I forgot my password?,"For myHF area password: Click 'Forgot Password' on the login page, enter your email, and follow reset instructions. For trading account password: Log into myHF area, go to My Trading Accounts, click the settings icon next to your account, and select 'Change Password'. You'll need to verify with OTP sent to your registered email."
qa_142,How do I update my personal information?,"To update personal information, send an email from your registered email address to the contact email on our Contact Us page.

qa_144,What is the difference between MT4 and MT5?,"MT4 is the classic platform focused on forex trading with simple interface and wide EA support.

Choose MT4 for simplicity and EA compatibility, MT5 for advanced features."
qa_145,How do I install custom indicators?,"Download the indicator file (.ex4 or .mq4), open MT4/MT5, go to File > Open Data Folder > MQL4 (or MQL5) > Indicators, paste the file there, restart the platform. The indicator will appear in Navigator > Indicators > Custom. Drag it onto a chart to use. For MT5, files go in MQL5 > Indicators folder."
qa_146,What is economic calendar and how to use it?,"Economic calendar shows scheduled economic events that can impact currency prices (interest rate decisions, employment data, GDP releases). High-impact events are marked in red and can cause significant volatility. Use it to plan trades, avoid trading during major news, or position for expected market movements. Available in MT5 and on our website."
qa_147,How do I set up price alerts?,"In MT4/MT5, right-click on a chart, select 'Create Alert', set your price level and notification type (popup, email, sound). You can also set alerts in the mobile app. Alerts notify you when price reaches specific levels without keeping the platform open constantly. Useful for monitoring multiple instruments or waiting for entry/exit points."
qa_148,What is swap-free trading?,"Swap-free (Islamic) accounts don't charge or pay overnight interest on positions held past market close, complying with Islamic finance principles.
